# Impact to Organization

## Minimum Qualifications
### **Senior Scientist** - Bachelor’s degree in relevant discipline plus fifteen or more years of experience, or equivalent.
### **DistinguiId** - Bachelor’s degree in relevant discipline plus twelve or more years of experience, or equivalent.
I have a Masters degree in Computer Science, as well as fifteen years experience in High Performance Computing.  I spent thirteen years at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I was hired on after a year as a Post-Master's Intern, focusing on Software Quality Assurance and HPC testing. From that internship, I joined a production software team, where I balanced responsibilities from software support for HPC scientific software installations upon HPC systems at LANL, including installation management, testing and Tier 3/4 support tickets and testing HPC systems. 

**Mustang Supercomputer Project**:  *Gary Grider Division Leader*, *Jeff Johnson, Group Leader*:  Very unstable supercomputer in production that was almost unusable due to anomalous behavior and unreliability: At LANL, I was often given the responsibility of leading concerted testing efforts, including a large project to systematically root-cause performance and stability issues on a SuperMicro TLCC2-like system, that featured AMD Magny-cours processors, and QLogic HSN. Problems on this system ranged from fundamental flaws on the motherboard design, to the cabinet configuration, as well as NUMA configurations and datacenter cooling problems. I formed a small "tiger" team ranging from performance experts, systems architects, network engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers, and we analyzed the totality of the system, using benchmarks and LDMS data to support performance anomalies until we were able to stabilize the system for improved performance and stability. The outcomes of this project fed into future acquisitions and data center design decisions.

## Nature of Work
- Her technical expertise impact spans multiple Orgs, Divisions, and Laboratories, as I am sought out for advice and technical input in the areas of Programming Environments in HPC, Performance Analysis Tools, Accelerator Performance APIs, Package Management approaches (SPACK, RPM, Debian), Build Utilities (git, CMake, GNUMake), Container Orchestration Tools (Charliecloud, Podman, Gitlab CI, Github Actions, Docker), Cloud Infrastructure, HPC Performance Testing and Benchmarking, and HPC workload analysis and debugging. 
## Creativity
- I created a new approach to packaging our LDMS product, integrating RPM and Debian packaging into a CICD workflow that builds LDMS in Linux containers, then deploys LDMS as a system service running in those containers for ultimately transforming our build-test-deploy capability, with the goal target of deploying a Terraform cluster using these containers to do automated functional, scale, deployment, and resiliency testing of our flagship product. 
## Operational Latitude
- I helped to interview and hire-on new four matrixed employees to file roles on the 9328 Operational Analytics team, and defined initial workplans to get them ramped up and productive in a short time frame.  Those projects have been handed over to the new staff members, who are now contributing to the projects independently after initial training and mentoring.
- I has been pulled into roles representing Sandia in the DOE NNSA ASC Software Strategy project, serving on the Cloud Computing and Programming Environment sub-working groups.  The latter is building on a Tri-laboratory launched in 2023, the ASC-PE project, that I initiated during her last year at LANL prior to joining Sandia, however the tenets and plans are continuing building on her original vision and direction, and I’s still pulled in as an SME in this project.
## Responsibility for Contacts
- I was invited to and participated in a 9321 Solutions Architect Experienced hiring committee, where I assisted in evaluating technical capabilities of candidates, and helped the committee reach a final decision on selecting a new hire.
- I regularly serves on review committees for the DOE (L2 IC ElCap 2025 for SPARC and EMPIRE, OLCF-6 Technical Design Review) and for technical conferences (IPDPS, SC, LDMSCON), serving as Vice-Chair for the SC’25 Reproducibility Committee, and Chair for SC’26 Reproducibility Committee AD/AE, and a member of the LDMSCON steering committee.
- I mentors staff on the team, bringing new ideas and technical approaches to supplying software for LDMS streams deamon installations on our systems.  I enabled a module file framework that enabled templated module files that dynamically adjust paths to library installation depending on user’s loaded environment.  I led her colleagues on setting up automation via Gitlab CICD to enable continuous testing and deployment of those plugin libraries to ensure usability, availability, and reliability of the software, while educating staff on new tools and approaches.
- I worked with LANL’s student intern to effectively install, configure, and deploy LDMS monitoring across their datacenter.  I continues to work with LANL to ensure that they can continue to maintain their monitoring capability amid system upgrades, new system acquisitions, and staff changes.
- I works with Industry to build specialized packages for supporting switch hardware running on HPE’s Slingshot Switches.  I works with OGC and actively supports LDMS as a product, fixing issues I encounters and building new capability.  I am trained and assigned as an SDR on the OGC contract, and ensures that the vendor is on target, the deliverables are met, and works through technical obstacles when encountered.
## Sphere of Influence / Potential Impact on Organizations
- I leads the LDMS deployment project, where I’s taken lead over the Operational Analytics team’s production support project, and achieved uniformity in our LDMS installations across the datacenter.  I organized work and priority to ensure that we progressed towards continued improvement and hardened installations for the system configurations, deployment model, and installation management processes for deployments on production systems.  This included integration into the 9327 GMI team, where I enabled LDMS in the base installations, utilizing packages direct from the TOSS repositories, feeding into those packages Sandia specific requirements to ensure we could leverage them.
- Her expertise is utilized in the standup and support of the ATS-3 Sandia system, Tachi, the ATS-4 Sandia system, El Dorado, where I’s assisted code teams to get their applications running, helped system administration and architecture staff in debugging errors on the systems, and led the effort to establish a software support posture to ensure that those systems are close proxies to their parent systems at LANL and LLNL, respectively.
